1. I am using XG Boost Algorithm to predict  the lead Category (High potential, low potential).
2. XG Boost algorithm can use gradient boosting framework and used  for both classification and the regression kind of problems. XG Boost is an implementation of gradient boosted decision trees designed for speed and performance.
3. In this Algorithm Learning from previous model called ADA boost.
4. It Mispredicted data is predicted of previous model.
5. The Combined having efficiency greater than and might be (80%-85%) called Boosting.
Ex: - It can be used for quality Assessment.
